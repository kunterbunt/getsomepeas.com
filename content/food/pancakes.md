These pancakes are really simple to make.

Ingredients
---

Let's start with the **vegan version:**


|  | Ingredients |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| 300g          | wheat or spelt flour |
| 500g          | water      |
| a little | salt      |
| some | fat for frying (e.g. olive oil) |

<br></br>
Or if you'd rather have the **dairy version:**

|  | Ingredients |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| 300g          | wheat or spelt flour |
| 1 or 2 | eggs |
| <500g | water or milk (fill up enough liquid so that together with the eggs you're at 500g liquids) |
| a little | salt      |
| some | fat for frying (e.g. olive oil, butter, ghee) |

<br></br>

What to do
---


Put all ingredients into a bowl and whisk until it's a smooth liquid dough. ![It should look something like this.](/imgs/posts/pancakes/liquid.jpg)

 Let it sit for 15 minutes.

Heat one or two pans (two is faster) to medium heat.

Heat up some fat in a pan and add one ladle of dough. ![Use about this much.](/imgs/posts/pancakes/in-pan.jpg)

Now is a good moment to add apple slices to the liquidy dough so that they're baked into the pancake.

Cover the pan and fry for ~5min

Turn over (by tossing into the air if you're cool) and fry other side until it's golden-brown.   
If you want you can add some cheese now and then fold the pancake, melting it in the middle.
