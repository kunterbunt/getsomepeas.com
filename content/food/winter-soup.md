It is winter time here in Hamburg, and as we try to cook seasonally that means mostly cabbage varieties and potatoes.

For cold days a hearty soup is best, so here's our take at one:

Ingredients
---

|  | Ingredients |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| 600g (two handful) | potatoes |
| 1          | large carrot      |
| 1 | large beetroot |
| 1 | large parsnip |
| 3 | onions |
| 5 | garlic cloves |
| 8 | dried chilis (if you like it spicy) |
| ~10 | Sichuan peppercorns |
| 1 tsp | coriander |
| a good bit | herbs of your liking (oregano, basil, ...) |
| 1 tsb | paprika powder |
| to taste | salt and pepper (if in doubt, add more pepper) |
| a bit of | olive oil for frying |
| ~1l | water |

What to do

Chop up the ingredients. It doesn't need to be tiny bits since you'll be puréeing the soup later on.

Heat up the olive oil in a large pot and add all veggies but garlic and onions. Fry for about 10 minutes.   
Now add onions and garlic and fry for another 10 minutes.

Add herbs and spices and fry for a couple of minutes. Now add enough water to just barely cover the vegetables.

Cook until everything's al dente, then purée the whole thing. Season with salt and pepper.

Serve with coarse salt, some sour cream and grated cheese. Enjoy! :)
